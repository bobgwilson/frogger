# Frogger
This is my Unity clone of first level of the Frogger arcade game, created for the Classic Game Project assignment for class MI 231 at Michigan State University.

I designed the software first as a UML class diagram in Visual Paradigm, with classes for BitmapFont, Character, GameManager, Home, LivesDisplay, MovingObject, MusicManager, NumberDisplay, Player, Racecar, SoundManager, Timer, and TurtleGroup.

I then developed the game in Unity,  programming the C# code in JetBrains Rider. This is my first game project that I've written all the code from scratch without any starter scripts.

Controls: up, down, left, right arrow keys.
